# UCS App

In 2013, as a short demonstration, I created this app within three hours, to allow prospective parents to view information about the school, and also, to provide students with a usable homework-diary which automagically downloaded their subjects from Moodle and used Core-Data to store their homework.

In 2014, the school switched VLE providers to Firefly and therefore this app became redundant and was consequently removed from the App Store.
